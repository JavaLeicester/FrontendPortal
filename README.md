# How to Contribute
### Trello and Github Integration

## Introduction

Trello is used to represent the state of our Github repositories.
One Github repo = One Trello Board.
Always use Trello as the immediate go to when wanting to know what to do.

We use lists to divide our Trello board into sections. Each section represents the state of where our tasks are.
The sections are divided as follows: General Backlog, Backlog, In Progress, For Revision and Done.

Each task that we have to complete in our application can be represented as a card.

## Backlog
At the start of each sprint we take tasks from the general backlog and put them into the weekly backlog. Once we
define the tasks in the weekly backlog, they do not change for that week. Each team member assigns themselve to a
card. When a user assigns themselve to card then a branch in Github must also be made. The branch name must resonate
with the card.

## In Progress
When a team member is working on a task then it must be in the "In Progress" list.
A team member is allowed to attach a git branch and a pull request to the card.
While you are working on your task attach, all the resources that were used to complete the
complete your assignment (Links to videos, online tutorials etc). This will help when you
want to remember how you did a certain task.

## For Revision
When a team member has completed a task then the card must be moved from "In Progress" to "For Revision".
The card must have the branch and a pull request attachment on it as well, for direct access.

## Done
The team member who reviewed the card is responsible for moving the card from "For Revision" to "Done"
